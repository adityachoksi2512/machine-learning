# Machine Learning Assignments
This repo includes implementation of various machine learning models to predict target variable (continuous/label). The series of assignments are a part of Graduate class of Applied Machine Learning (UTD BUAN 6341). <br/>
* `Assignment 1` – Linear and Logistic Regression with Gradient Descent Algorithm
* `Assignment 2` – Support Vector Classification with Linear, Radial and Polynomial Kernel, Decision Tree Classifier, Pruned Decision Tree Classifier, and AdaBoost Decision Tree Classifier
* `Assignment 3` – k-Nearest Neighbors Classifier, Artificial Neural Network Classifier

## About Data
* [Seoul Bike Sharing Demand Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Seoul+Bike+Sharing+Demand) – The dataset contains information regarding number of bikes rented on an hourly basis for a year and includes prevailing weather conditions.
